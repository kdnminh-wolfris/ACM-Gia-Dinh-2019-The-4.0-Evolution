# ACM Gia Định 2019: The 4.0 Evolution

**What is ACM Gia Định?**

ACM Gia Định is an amateur programming competition in Informatics and Mathematics for students in Gia Dinh High school. Founded by Khau Dang Nhat Minh in July 2019, ACM Gia Định officially firstly launched to the public with 2 main events which are *Workshop: The 4.0 Evolution* on August 25, 2019 and *ACM Gia Định 2019: The 4.0 Evolution - Competition Day and Results Announcement Ceremony* on October 6, 2019.

**Why *The 4.0 Evolution*?**

Along with the world's transformation itself into the fourth industrial revolution, we as students also have to adapt to the changes of the world. Algorithm plays an important role in Industry 4.0 so we proudly introduce a whole new competition in Informatics and Mathematics for Gia Dinh High school students.

**What urged us to the decision to organize the competition?**

I found that a lot of universities have held competitions in Informatics to bring students a place to play and learn about algorithms, arithmetic, etc. However, it's not like that in a high school environment. In Vietnam, algorithms or more broadly, Informatics, hasn't got its right stand. Because of that, my friends and I want to be pioneers who create a competition with the purpose to change the way pupils see Informatics into how it should be.
